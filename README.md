# Emotion-Recognition-con-Data-Augmentation-e-Transfer-Learning
University project of Images recognition 

The image-based emotion recognition task is a very current problem that has been made possible in recent years by the advent of increasingly robust Deep ML models that can guarantee excellent performance.

In this project, this task was integrated with an additional problem, that of using Deep Learning on a dataset of very low dimensionality.

Therefore, a comparison of two different Deep Learning methodologies aimed at improving performance on a dataset with emotion recognition task and a small number of observations was developed.
